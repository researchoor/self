This is /[[me]]/, maybe.

{% include linebreak.html %}

Here are some [[causes]] that are more important then me. Required reading, otherwise you've proven there are better ways to spend your time.

I like asking [[questions]] and being dissapointed by the answers. Computers are good at coming up with answers so I use them more then I like, but I've gotten good enough to think about them less. If you prefer something less cryptic, [[work]] is your stay.

This was going to be the part where I talk about myself, but I could only think of cultural touch points in reference to a fictional version of myself.

Huh... too bad.

Feel free to listen along instead.
