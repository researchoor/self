Level of seperation from humanity, community, and relationships.

Historically I have a habit to isolate, which of course is cyclically self-fulfilling. Lonely people stay lonely.

However isolation isn't inherently a loss in life. It just so happens to follow many as a result of depression, degenaracy, and loss. But there could be a world where a need for others is built on psyche that isn't required. /I/ just so happen to want to hug literally anyone right now.
