Creating an anxiety based on having a mental obsession of another anxiety.

For example, you may have a fear of flights. But the real manifested fear may be a result of the hyperfixation on your fear of flights. This can result in two seperate cases of anxiety or simply one if the original anxiety doesn't actually manifest.

Here's a common format, "I hate that thing. I really hate how I react to that thing. I hope when I'm forced to interact with that thing I won't experience those symptoms. Why does it bother me so much? It's not even a big deal". As a result the dread is built off the meta internal conversation as opposed to the original fear.
