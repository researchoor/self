God I'm so fucking tired.

I'm tired of the shitty people â€” no.

I'm tired of the shitty attitudes.

I'm tired of the shitty environements.

I'm tired of dealing with people reacting to those environments with those attitudes.

I'm tired of how I react poorly to those reactions.

I'm fucking tired.

But sleeping doesn't wake me up.

A nice day in the sun,

watching some cricket,

trying to read a book for the 89th time,

that doesn't even do the trick even if I tell others the moment.

I hate it everytime, but thats alright.

I dont know if it's alright.

It shouldn't be alright.

It shouldn't be alright.

It shouldn't be alright.

It shouldn't be alright.

It shouldn't be alright.

All I want is for it to be not right.

Why is it not right.

Why am I not alright.
