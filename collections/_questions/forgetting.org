#+TITLE: Forgetting — The Benefits of N⁠ot Remembering?
#+LAYOUT: short

I liked when they said not remembering shit makes you nice and similar to bonobos cause you're too dumb to be mean. 

Unfortunatley being light on details made the arguments sound so oversimplified. At no point was the thing I thought about the most, "why can't we just remember the right stuff", ever really addressed.

I understand that not remembering stuff can allow you to extrapolate more, but I really don't need to extrapolate on say --- someone's birthday.

And there's no fucking way I'm gonna bother remembering that.

Also felt pretty brave to punctuate a pop psychology book by saying

Huh, it's really up in the air if my theory was right at all. Maybe smart people are just smart and it has nothing to do with forgetting things.

At least pretend to be confident in your narrative.
