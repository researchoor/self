Traditionally I haven't been that interested in getting my hands dirty.

I had enough bad feedback in my life to realize my /place/.

And this isn't a means to avoid "blue-collar" work. Oil paints are occult in nature, and I fail to focus a film camera 90% of the time.

A clutz like me falls a lot in a world of potholes.

After reading [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zen_and_the_Art_of_Motorcycle_Maintenance][Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance]] I feel obligated to reconsider my pissy reactions to any task with physical tools.

It's not a perfect book, but it probably deserves a formalized [[../thoughts][thought]] or two. More likely it will hiss in my head until another paradigm manages to wriggle through the sludge and I'll claim that snake solves everything.

Anyways bike repairs maybe? I should write that down somewhere.
