#+TITLE: How should I represent nâ€‹oise as text?

If I really want to start hosting a blog that no one will read I need to set a few ground rules:

- Be able to write the post using org
- Have some way to play an attached song while reading
- Have a banner image at the bottom like a terrible forum user tag

* org-mode
Using org for writing is a bit of a no brainer for me. It's the primary way I write any extended or short form text. And more importantly it exports to anything!

If you want my terse pitch for org-mode, I've got a bit in my [[emacs][configuration]] for emacs that doubles as a "question".

Unfortunatly I am not playing to it's strengths.

As of now I'm using a jekyll plugin called =jekyll-org=. Pretty straight forward.

However it's current gem is a version from 2019. I could use a =git submodule= if I cared enough to get the most recent commits, but I don't think that would solve the ongoing kinks that I run into my day to day of writing posts:

- including content (with =#+INCLUDE= for example) from a seperate org-file does not render as you would expect
- using =liquid= tags are very binary, a post either renders them or doesn't, there is no pick and choose
- only the =#+TAGS= header parses as a list, can't have proper arbitrary header lists
- when I include "no" in a document's title, say for example "noise", it evaluates as =false=. Insane. I've used a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-width_space][zero-width]] space to workaround it for now (which is literally reccomended in the org-mode [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Escape-Character.html][docs]])
- using =#+ATTR_HTML= to try an alter an image does not affect it's export

In the longterm I think it would be for the best to properly just use =org-publish= for my static generation. Or at least use something like [[https://github.com/bmaland/happyblogger][this]] that lets you control the org document rendering before jekyll gets its hands on it.

* Banner
As apposed to doing a simple image, I really wanted to have a proper sprawling, repeating, banner. Which is pretty easy:

#+BEGIN_SRC html
<div
    class="box banner"
    style="background-image: url(/static/media/banner.gif);
           height: 40px">
</div>
#+END_SRC

and again in my =org= documents header arguments:

#+BEGIN_SRC
#+BANNER: stars.gif
#+END_SRC

results in:

{% include banner.html banner='stars.gif'%}

simple.
