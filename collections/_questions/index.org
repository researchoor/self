Looks like I have {{ collection.docs | size }} questions. I really doubt I'll have more.

{% include question-item.html question_name='computers' %}

Oh you're still here? These might be useful then:

{% include question-list.html questions='analog,dirt' %}

{% assign types = site.git.last_commit.commit_date | split: ' ' %}

That's all.
