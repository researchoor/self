I guess so. They were pretty useful for answering this:

{% include question-list.html questions='symbols' %}

#+BEGIN_COMMENT
Sometimes they're even flexible:

{% include question-list.html questions='sap,vr' %}

But honestly they often feel like they just ask more questions:

{% include question-list.html questions='vps,self' %}

and God they're selfish:

{% include question-list.html questions='rounded,xtext' %}
#+END_COMMENT

Up in the air I guess.
