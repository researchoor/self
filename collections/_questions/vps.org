#+TITLE: How should I host my own stuff?

As simply and frugally as possible ideally.

Currently I need to be able to host:
- This website
- A [[https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse][synapse]] instance
- Any dumb webapp idea I come up with at any moment
- Preferably containers

Pretty attainable.

* Nginx
* Self
* Synapse
* Watchtower

As of now it's all pretty functional on a minimal $5/month VPS @ [[https://vultr.com][vultr]] which is good enough for me.
