The concept of value generated via action. What do I get out of doing X? However utility is often referred to as a resulting metric for easily measurable benefits. Example:

#+begin_quote
How much does doing X provide food and water?
#+end_quote

Which is then in turn used with whatever input of effort and resources to calculate the efficiency of said action. 

I don't really know if that's accurate (no word is), but I tend to use it in those more limited terms as to not cause confusion.

Refering to your actions as "maximizing your moral utility" does feel good though.
